Documenting some questions which came up during implementation.

What to do if unit walks forward into a crevice too narrow for them to
turn out of accorrding to their fixed turning radius?
  * Allow backing up (would look odd for many unit types)
  * Allow a very low turning radius if unit has no forward velocity
     * This would work OK for ships and flying units, less so for cavalry
(Granted this is a rather pathological case.)

Would it be possible to see the code used by other units during pathfinding?
  * The current code for turn radius will eventually need to be integrated
    with that of other units to avoid collisions. Want to make sure the
    strategies are compatible.

Are there details on how the Navigation mesh will take into account
shroud / fog of war / visible terrain?  BMFE had three classifications:
  * shroud (black) for completely unknown areas
  * fog of war (terrain but no dynamic unit/building info) for
    discovered but not currently visible terrain
  * visible (able to see all)

Currently my path planning behaves as if the entire map is visible, but this
would certainly need to change at some point (units should not pathfind based
on information they have not yet discovered).  I have tried to plan ahead for
this by directly computing only a subset of the path and recalculating the
path as the unit approaches their destination.  Hopefully this can be repurposed
to account for gradual information gain (depending on units vision stat).
