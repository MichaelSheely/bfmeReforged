Documenting some questions which came up during implementation.

What to do if unit walks forward into a crevice too narrow for them to
turn out of accorrding to their fixed turning radius?
  * Allow backing up (would look odd for many unit types)
  * Allow a very low turning radius if unit has no forward velocity
     * This would work OK for ships and flying units, less so for cavalry
(Granted this is a rather pathological case.)

-> Tested this with classic BFME2 (tested with Angmar troll stone thrower).
Unit simply stops and rotates in place without a turn radius.
Also tested use of "battle formations mode" (holding both mouse buttons + drag).
In this case, the unit was also able to rotate on the spot without the use of
a turning radius.  This seems to imply that the units turning radius depends on
the speed of the unit (not necessarily linear), perhaps simply the picewise fn:
```math
$$ turning_radius(speed) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc}
0 \text{ when } speed = 0 \\
R \text{ when } speed > 0
\end{array} $$
```
where `R` is some parameter particular to the unit in question.


Would it be possible to see the code used by other units during pathfinding?
  * The current code for turn radius will eventually need to be integrated
    with that of other units to avoid collisions. Want to make sure the
    strategies are compatible.

Are there details on how the Navigation mesh will take into account
shroud / fog of war / visible terrain?  BMFE had three classifications:
  * shroud (black) for completely unknown areas
  * fog of war (terrain but no dynamic unit/building info) for
    discovered but not currently visible terrain
  * visible (able to see all)


Currently my path planning behaves as if the entire map is visible, but this
would certainly need to change at some point (units should not pathfind based
on information they have not yet discovered).  I have tried to plan ahead for
this by directly computing only a subset of the path and recalculating the
path as the unit approaches their destination.  Hopefully this can be repurposed
to account for gradual information gain (depending on units vision stat).


How to people visualize their computations to double check / screenshot?
(e.g. drawing paths on the terrain to sanity check the planned route?)
I had a bad solution of dropped some large artifacts on the map and then
marking them as dropped, but there must be a standard way of doing this.


Camera stuff (bfme has separate camera controlled by player not affected
by unit movement).  Currently camera is following the actor as they move,
but of course in bfme we don't want camera to be affected by units.
Not sure how the code for overhead camera control will work in bfme:R.
-> Not sure if this is the best way to go about this, but I resolved this
by adding a fixed camera to the stage by using
`Window > Editor Modes > Modes Panel` and then adding a default camera to the
level.  After this, it can be set as the recording device by using the
`World Outliner` pane to edit the CameraActor and setting it to be
"piloted" so that it is used for populating the viewport.


Interesting finding: PFollowComp->GetStatus() returns
EPathFollowingStatus::Moving even when it seems like movement
should be completed (player pawn is right on top of the destination).
